                  The ICC Cricket World Cup is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the sport of cricket, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). First held in 1975, the tournament features the top cricketing nations competing in the One-Day International (ODI) format, traditionally played over 50 overs per side. The World Cup is contested every four years, with the host country rotating among ICC member nations.
                   Over the years, Australia has been the most successful team, winning the tournament five times (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015), followed by India with two titles (1983 and 2011), and West Indies, who claimed the trophy in 1975 and 1979. England won their first World Cup in 2019 in a dramatic final against New Zealand, while Pakistan (1992) and Sri Lanka (1996) have each won once. The tournament typically includes
                    a round-robin group stage, followed by knockout rounds, with the top teams advancing to the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and ultimately the final. The 2023 World Cup, hosted by India, saw the host nation emerge as the champions, adding another chapter to the tournament's rich history. The ICC Cricket World Cup is a global spectacle, drawing millions of fans from around the world who tune in to watch the thrilling matches
                     and celebrate the spirit of cricket.</figcaption></figure>

                   with teams from all around the world competing for the title of world champion in the shortest format of the game.
